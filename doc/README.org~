#+Title: Literate, documented source code
#+Author: Mark Armstrong
#+Description: 

This directory contains the raw Agda source files,
“tangled” from the files in [[file:./../doc/][the ~doc~ folder]].

Be aware that if changes are made to these files, they will be lost
if the files are tangled from ~doc~ again.
